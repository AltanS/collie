# Architecture decision records

Decisions with a **blast radius wider than the diff that made them** — the ones a future
contributor (or a future agent) would otherwise re-derive from scratch, or quietly reverse because
the reasoning lived only in a PR thread.

One file per decision, numbered in the order they were accepted:

```
.adr/NNNN-kebab-case-title.md
```

Format is [Michael Nygard's](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions):
**Context** (the forces, including what was actually measured), **Decision** (what we do, in the
imperative), **Consequences** (what this costs, and what would justify revisiting it).

## When to write one

Write an ADR when a decision **closes off an option someone will reasonably propose again**. The
signal is that you find yourself explaining *why not* rather than *how*.

- ✅ "We manage exactly one front door" — a NetBird PR, then a Cloudflare Tunnel PR, then a ZeroTier PR
- ✅ "Polling, not an event stream" — perennial, and the reasoning isn't obvious from the code
- ❌ "Use Vitest for the web suite" — that's just what the repo does; `CLAUDE.md` covers it
- ❌ Anything already legible from the code, a test name, or a commit message

## Relationship to the other docs

Nothing here restates what lives elsewhere; the point is the *reasoning*, once.

| Where | What belongs there |
| --- | --- |
| [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) | The **rule** — short, normative, linking here for why |
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) | How the system is **built**, as it stands today |
| [`README.md`](../README.md) | How an operator **runs** it |
| `.adr/` | Why a road **wasn't** taken |

A superseded ADR is never deleted or edited into agreement with the present. Mark it
`Superseded by NNNN` and write the new one — the wrong turn is the useful part.
