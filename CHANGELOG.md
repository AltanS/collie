# Changelog

All notable changes to Collie are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The newest `## [x.y.z]` heading **must** match the
`version` in `herdr-plugin.toml`, `package.json`, and `web/package.json` (enforced by
`scripts/check-version.sh`). See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) → *Versioning* for the bump policy.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- **Smarter push notifications.** A blocked/done alert is no longer fire-and-forget. Each one now
  waits a short **debounce window** (`COLLIE_NOTIFY_DELAY_MS`, default 30s) before it sends; an agent
  you clear at your desk within that window never reaches your phone. Alerts that *do* fire are
  **retracted** automatically once the agent resolves (or its pane closes), so handled work stops
  piling up on your lock screen. The service worker also **suppresses** the system notification when a
  Collie tab is already open and visible (the in-app status surfaces it instead).
- **Coalesced into one notification.** The whole herd shares a single notification slot: one agent
  shows the named, deep-linked alert; several collapse into a *"N agents need you"* digest (tap → the
  triage home) that updates in place as agents come and go, instead of stacking N separate alerts.

### Added
- **Do Not Disturb / snooze** (Settings → *Do not disturb*): pause all push for 30m / 1h / 4h, or
  resume early. Server-enforced and self-expiring, so it quiets every device — and it clears whatever
  is already on the lock screen the moment you snooze. The current deadline rides the snapshot, so it
  stays in sync across devices.
- `COLLIE_NOTIFY_DELAY_MS` env var — the push debounce window in ms (default `30000`; `0` notifies on
  the next tick with no debounce).
- `POST /api/notifications/snooze` — set/clear the global snooze (`{ snoozedUntil: number | null }`);
  the active deadline is reported on the snapshot as `notifications.snoozedUntil`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

Initial public release of **Collie** — a phone web UI to monitor and reply to your Herdr agent
herd over Tailscale.

### Added
- **Mobile-first PWA** (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn): a triage dashboard
  (Spaces overview + Needs-you / Working / Idle agent groups), a per-agent colored terminal mirror,
  an agent-aware slash-command palette (Claude Code, Codex, pi, opencode), a special-keys pad with
  inline arrows/Tab, per-agent brand icons, image upload, and animated view transitions. Installable,
  with an auto-updating service worker and a build-stamp footer.
- **Bun/TypeScript bridge** over Herdr's Unix socket: a polled live snapshot (adaptive cadence,
  gzip + `ETag`/`304`) plus reply / keys / upload endpoints, and space/tab/pane management (create
  shell panes, switch, kill) through a unified nav hub.
- **Runs as a `systemd --user` service** supervised independently of Herdr, with a `tailscale serve`
  launcher (`scripts/collie-ctl.sh`) and a thin Herdr plugin (`herdr.collie`) exposing
  start / stop / restart / status / url / version / update / uninstall actions. One-command update
  (pull → rebuild → restart → re-link) for the linked checkout.
- **Optional Web Push (VAPID) notifications** when an agent needs you, with a custom service-worker
  push handler that renders the real message and deep-links the tap to the agent's pane.
- **Security posture:** loopback-only bind, `tailscale serve` as the sole ingress (never `funnel`),
  a same-origin gate, an optional `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` identity check, optional per-device
  authorisation via a trusted upstream header, a strict CSP, and terminal output rendered as React
  text nodes (the XSS boundary).
